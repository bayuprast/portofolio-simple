# Bayu's Modern Abstract Portfolio 🎨🚀

A premium, responsive, and highly interactive personal portfolio website built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project features a unique "Fluid & Premium" aesthetic with animated abstract background gradients that change seamlessly as you scroll.

## ✨ Features

- **Fluid Abstract Backgrounds:** Unique animated blobs for each section (Hero, About, Projects, Contact) providing a dynamic visual experience.
- **Seamless Transitions:** No harsh borders between sections; background colors blend naturally during scrolling.
- **Expandable Floating Navbar:** A sleek, interactive navigation bar that expands and collapses on interaction.
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Modern UI with semi-transparent cards, subtle blurs, and premium shadow effects.
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile to ultra-wide desktops.
- **Smooth Animations:** Integrated with `framer-motion` for micro-interactions, floating elements, and reveal-on-scroll effects.
- **Functional Contact Form:** Clean and modern contact section for user inquiries.
